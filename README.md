#Sublime Text Flat Icon for Mac

![ScreenShot](example.png)

N.B. The orange colour in the example above is not as vivid as the icon itself

##Installation
Select the Sublime Text app in Finder, and choose “Show Package Contents” from the context menu.

Navigate to the Contents > Resources folder, and replace “Sublime Text.icns” with the new file.

Alternatively, you can inspect/get info on Sublime Text.app and drag the new icon onto the old to replace it to just replace the Finder / Dock icon.

You may need to enter your password to authorise the write.

Most of the time, you will have to remove Sublime from the Dock and re-add it to see any changes reflected.

##Windows & Linux
It should be relatively trivial to build Windows and Linux icons from the included PNGs if you would like. If you would like to contribute back to the project, that’d be much appreciated!

##Attribution
Please feel free to rip off, edit, and fork this icon as much as you like, but I would appreciate some attribution, thanks!
